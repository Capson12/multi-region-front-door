# Multi-Region Web Application with Azure
This README outlines the architecture and setup for a highly available, multi-region web application using Azure services.
Architecture Overview
Our multi-region web application leverages the following Azure services:
	•	Azure Front Door
	•	Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets
	•	Azure Load Balancer
    •   Azure NAT Gateway
	•	Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
	•	Network Security Groups (NSGs)
Key Components
Azure Front Door
Azure Front Door serves as the global entry point for our application, providing:
	•	Global load balancing across regions
	•	Custom domain support
	•	Health probes for intelligent routing
Virtual Machine Scale Sets
VM Scale Sets enable us to:
	•	Automatically scale our application instances
	•	Distribute traffic across multiple VMs
	•	Ensure high availability within each region
Load Balancer
Azure Load Balancer is used for:
	•	Regional load balancing within each VNet
	•	Health probing of backend instances
	•	Configurable distribution modes for optimal routing
Virtual Network (VNet)
VNets are configured to:
	•	Isolate and secure our application 
    •	Enable communication between components within each region
	•	Allow controlled inter-region communication when necessary
Network Security Groups (NSGs)
NSGs are applied to:
	•	Filter traffic to and from Azure resources
	•	Implement security rules at the subnet or network interface level

Multi-Region Setup
	1.	Deploy identical infrastructure in two Azure regions.
	2.	Configure Azure Front Door to distribute traffic across regional deployments.
	3.	Set up VM Scale Sets in each region to handle varying loads.
	4.	Implement regional load balancers to distribute traffic within each VNet.
	5.	Configure NSGs and ASGs to secure communication between components.
High Availability and Failover
	•	Azure Front Door provides instant global failover to the next optimal regional deployment.
	•	VM Scale Sets automatically replace unhealthy instances within each region.
	•	Regional load balancers route traffic to healthy instances.
Scaling
	•	VM Scale Sets can automatically scale up or down based on defined metrics.
	•	Azure Front Door distributes traffic across regions for optimal performance and load distribution.
Security
	•	Implement a WAF policy with Azure Front Door to protect against common web exploits.
	•	Use NSGs to control traffic flow between subnets and external networks.
	•	Leverage ASGs to simplify security management for application tiers.
Monitoring and Management
	•	Utilize Azure Monitor for comprehensive monitoring of all components.
	•	Implement health probes at both the Front Door and regional load balancer levels.
	•	Use Azure Security Center for security recommendations and threat protection.
